NCT06371989,Vacuum Assisted Biopsy and Surgery Correlation in HER2 and TN Breast Cancer Subtypes MRI Responders After Neoadjuvant Therapy: BISUCO TRIAL,Image guided vacuum assisted biopsy,PROCEDURE,,COMPLETED,"BACKGROUND AND CURRENT STATUS:

Advancements in neoadjuvant systemic treatments (NST) for HER2 positive and triple-negative (TN) breast cancer (BC) subtypes have led to high rates of pathologic complete response (pCR), raising questions about the necessity of subsequent surgery, especially for those undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy. While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains the most effective imaging technique for assessing neoadjuvant treatment response, surgery is still required to confirm pCR in cases of almost complete or complete MRI response (iCR). To safely avoid surgery in these BC ""exceptional responders,"" a technique with high negative predictive value is imperative.

OBJECTIVE:

This study aims to establish the diagnostic efficacy of image-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) in assessing pathological complete response (pCR) after NST in HER2 positive or TN breast cancer subtypes, particularly those showing post NST-MRI complete or almost complete response.

METHODS:

A prospective study was conducted at ""Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre de Madrid"" from June 25, 2018, to October 25, 2029. Twenty-five patients with HER2-positive or TN operable invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) BC subtype, at stages cT1-3/N0-2 undergoing primary NST and showing complete or almost complete response on post NST-MRI, were enrolled. Ultrasound or stereotactic-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) of the previous clip and tumor bed area was performed before surgery. VAB pathological results were compared with surgical pathological results to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of predicting pCR with VAB after NST. Pathological representativeness of the VAB sample was ensured. pCR was defined as the absence of invasive ductal carcinoma and in situ ductal carcinoma.",Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre,1.0

NCT01836640,Developing Plasma DNA as a Surrogate for Tumor Biopsy to Identify Tumor Genetic Alterations in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer,,,,TERMINATED,"There are three major subtypes of breast cancer:

1. Hormone receptor positive (contain cells that express the estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor).
2. Tumors that express the epidermal growth factor receptor gene ( HER-2)
3. Triple negative (cancer cells that lack the hormone receptors and the epidermal growth factor receptor gene HER-2.

While effective therapies exist for most cases of breast cancer at first occurrence, many patients eventually exhibit disease that does not respond to all standard breast therapies, particularly in the metastatic setting.

There are therapies that are used to treat other types of cancers with genetic mutations that are in the process of being evaluated for use in breast cancer. The current techniques used for detecting mutations in the genes of breast cancer patients, which can be treated with drugs specific for the genetic mutations, are invasive and identifying effective diagnostic non-invasive procedures are the next challenge for physicians. This study will compare the ability to detect genetic mutations samples from non-invasive procedures such as a blood draw, to more invasive procedures such as tissue taken from a biopsy sample.

There is also a concern with current techniques used to detect genetic mutations that cells from a single tissue sample may not be representative of the types of cells present in all the tumors in the body and therapies selected using a single tissue sample may not be effective for all of the cancer in the body. This study will use blood drawn from participants prior to any drug therapy and compare the genes from this blood to tissue samples from multiple sites of disease.

The study will also compare the genetic profile of the metastatic tumors to the genetic profile of the original breast cancer to determine if there are any changes in the genetics of the tumor cells.

The participants that have newly diagnosed metastatic disease will provide tissue from their primary site of disease via an image guided biopsy. These participants will also provide tissue from at least 2 other distant metastatic sites (lung, pleural/peritoneal, liver, brain, or skin).

It is characterized by its unique molecular profile, aggressive behavior, distinct patterns of metastasis, and lack of targeted therapies. Although not synonymous, the majority of triple-negative breast cancers carry the ""basal-like"" molecular profile on gene expression arrays.

Although sensitive to chemotherapy, early relapse is common and these cancers show a predilection for visceral metastasis, including brain metastasis. Targeted agents, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, are currently in clinical trials and hold promise in the treatment of this aggressive disease.

Multiple independent data sets have revealed that the triple negative type of breast cancer carries a poor prognosis. It is unclear whether the poor prognosis of triple negative breast cancer is due to poor therapy options or inherent aggressiveness. Given their triple negative receptor status, these tumors are not amenable to conventional targeted therapies for breast cancer, such as endocrine therapy or trastuzumab, leaving only chemotherapy in the therapeutic armamentarium.

Patients on metformin showed a 30-40% protection against all forms of cancer. Recent pilot studies carried out using population registries raise the possibility that metformin may reduce cancer risk and/or improve cancer prognosis. One showed an unexpectedly lower risk of a cancer diagnosis among diabetics using metformin compared with a control group of diabetics using other treatments ; another showed lower cancer-specific mortality among subjects with diabetes using metformin compared with diabetics on other treatments. Metformin is a biguanide known to be an insulin sensitizing agent which promotes reduced circulating insulin and glucose levels in hyper-glycaemic and hyper-insulinaemic patients. Metformin activates the AMP dependent kinase, attenuates insulin and IGF-1 stimulated proliferation in breast cancer cells and a general decrease in protein synthesis in vitro. Western blot analysis indicated that metformin stimulates AMPK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. AMPK activation is associated with decreased phosphorylation of mTOR and S6 kinase. While metformin reduces breast carcinoma cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, the activation of AMPK leads to significant VEGF production, angiogenesis and tumor progression. This must be taken into consideration when it is applied in as a therapeutic regimen.",Tata Memorial Hospital,1.0

""TRIFOUR Study""",Carboplatin; Gemcitabine; Nadunolimab,DRUG; DRUG; DRUG,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents approximately 15% of all breast cancers (BC) worldwide. The term triple negative means that tumor growth is not stimulated by the hormones estrogen and progesterone, nor by the HER2 protein, so unlike other types of BC, TNBC, which is an aggressive form of BC, does not have specific effective therapies available being the least common form of BC and the most difficult to treat.

Advanced or metastatic TNBC is treated with combinations of platinum-based chemotherapy with taxanes or gemcitabine with a 5-year survival rate of 12%. Recent studies have shown that TNBC expresses Interleukin 1 Receptor Accessory Protein (IL1RAP) at higher levels than other forms of BC.

Nadunolimab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the signals that occur within the cell produced by IL1RAP protein, thereby impairing the cancer cells' ability to secrete tumor stimulating substances, in turn reducing the tumor, inflammation and tumor progression. On the other hand, it is an antibody designed to activate the immune system to fight cancer cells.

This clinical trial is divided into two phases, phase Ib in which it is expected to include up to 15 patients and phase II in which it is expected to include 102 patients. The main purpose of phase Ib is to ensure that the combination of nadunolimab plus chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus carboplatin) is safe and determine the highest dose of nadunolimab that can be given safely without causing serious side effects.

The problem for patients who are not pCR is that they are currently receiving non-personalized adjuvant systemic treatment.

The identification of biomarkers present in the residual disease would be a criterion to guide the choice of post-neoadjuvant adjuvant systemic treatment, in order to personalize it.

At the present time, there is no published study describing extensively the immune micro-environment (ME) in breast cancer, whether before or after chemotherapy, nor its modification induced by chemotherapy.

The team therefore propose to study in a retrospective and monocentric series, the modifications of the immune ME induced by a ""standard"" neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with triple-negative CS, whether they are in complete histological response or not (n = twice 50).

The main objective of this project is to describe the changes in the immune ME of triple-negative breast cancers induced by neoadjuvant chemotherapy for all patients (in pCR or not):

Metastatic disease including metastatic breast cancer unfortunately remains incurable. One reason is due to the inability to develop specific therapies for specific cancer subsets.

The use of modern genomic techniques has significantly enhanced our recent understanding of breast cancer biology. Five distinct breast cancer subsets have been recognized, one of which is basal-like breast cancer. Basal-like breast cancer is typically estrogen receptor (ER) negative, progesterone receptor (PR) negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2-Neu) negative. This is referred to as triple negative breast cancer or TBNC. TBNC represents a significant proportion of breast cancer patients (10-20%) and has a poor prognosis with no targeted approach to therapy as of yet.

Tigatuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting a death receptor on the breast cancer cells.

Breast cancer was the first malignancy for which a predictive factor forecasting response to therapy was identified nearly 50 years ago; the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER). Furthermore, breast cancer is by far the malignancy in which prognostic and predictive factors have been most extensively studied. Primary medical treatment (pre-surgical medical therapy) offers a unique setting to explore predictive factors due to the fact that primary breast cancers are easily accessible to repeated tissue sampling and evaluation of therapy response both clinically and radiologically. For many years, the investigators have studied predictive factors in primary medical treatment of breast cancer. In the present project, the investigators will implement a new trial concept where the current knowledge from previous trials with respect to predictive markers (hormone receptors, HER2; TP53, CHEK2 and RB1), will be combined with massive parallel sequencing (MPS). Thereby, the investigators aim to design the ""next-generation"" primary medical treatment where 1) therapy regimens are individualized based on a limited number of known predictive factors and, 2) MPS is used to explore additional predictive factors and their co-regulators in order to fully identify the mechanisms of drug sensitivity / resistance across individual tumours and pave the way for further personalized breast cancer therapy in the future.

Radiotherapy improves both locoregional control and overall survival. In most patients with breast cancer the locoregional recurrence rate (LRR) is low, however still high LRRs are found in certain patient groups, especially in locally advanced, inflammatory and triple negative breast cancer. Olaparib is a potent PARP inhibitor developed as an anti-cancer drug for homologous recombination (HR) defected tumors and as a dose intensifier for chemo- and radiotherapy. The combination of olaparib and radiotherapy is expected to improve locoregional control and thereby overall survival in both breast cancer patients with a high probability of locoregional recurrence and patients with HR deficient tumors.

NCT01560663,Predictors of Response to Neoadjuvant Docetaxel-Carboplatin Chemotherapy for Patients With Stage II and III Triple Negative Breast Cancer,Docetaxel- Carboplatin,DRUG,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy is an interesting research tool which allows investigators to test new drugs and/or new schedules with a validated surrogate endpoint, pCR. It also represents an ideal model to evaluate the relationships between treatments and tumor biomarkers. Recent publications have shown that new molecular classifications of breast cancer (intrinsic subtypes) have an important prognostic and predictive value. Using microarrays for gene expression profiling seems to be the best way to perform this classification; nevertheless such assays are not optimally available for common clinical practice. The IHC-based classification systems are still useful, as fresh tissue is not normally available in clinical practice, and has been shown to correlate well with intrinsic classification using gene expression microarrays. Recently the PAM50 gene set provided a risk of relapse score not only in ER-positive, node negative patients (similarly to the Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score) but also in the ER negative disease. Additionally, the PAM 50 assay was highly predictive of neoadjuvant response when considering all patients. This assay added significant prognostic and predictive value to pathologic staging, histologic grade, and standard clinical molecular markers while using an easy technique that can be performed in clinical practice because the qRT-PCR assay can be performed using FFEP tissue.

Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is defined by a lack of expression of ER, PgR and HER-2. DNA microarray profiling studies have led to the classification of invasive breast carcinoma into five subtypes: luminal A and B, normal breast-like, HER2/neu overexpressing and basal-like subtypes, with clinical implications. Later on, a new subtype, the claudin-low, has been described. Although not synonymous, the majority of TNBCs carry the basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) molecular profile.

The triple negative subtype accounts for 11-20% of breast cancer in different studies, whereas in selected cohorts of patients with advanced breast cancer or African-American ethnicity, TNBC may be diagnosed among as many as 23-28%.

Patients with TN breast tumors treated with standard chemotherapy have a shorter DFS and OS than non-TNBC, this difference have been shown to be independent from tumor grade, nodal status and treatment in some studies. The peak risk of recurrence occurs within the first 3 years after initial treatment, with the majority of deaths occurring in the first five years.

Chemotherapy remains the only systemic treatment option available for TNBC patients. Several studies have shown that TNBC/BLBC is associated with an increased response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy when compared with luminal tumors. However, TNBC patients have a significantly decreased DFS and OS in comparison with luminal patients. The largest study exploring response and survival in early stage breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy was reported by Liedtke et al. Although an increase pCR rate was observed among the TNBC patients, they had a shorter lifespan than the non-TN ones. Patients experiencing pCR had an excellent OS regardless of hormone receptor expression, but patients with residual disease had a significantly shorter survival associated with TNBC compared with non-TN ones. This demonstrates that poor OS is derived from chemo-resistant patients (what unfortunately represent \> 50% of them).

A relevant problem is the differential response to drugs of TN tumors. These tumors are usually treated with multidrug combinations including anthracyclines and taxanes, with pCR´s of 28-32%. Only recently, the results of a few small trials combining platinum salts and taxanes have been reported, with encouraging results (pCR of 44-77%). The taxane-platinum salt combinations have a biological background, since TN not associated BRCA1 mutations are sensitive to taxanes and resistant to anthracyclines and platinum salts are effective in TN tumors probably because a significant proportion of them have functional DNA repair deficiencies.

The primary objective of the study is to identify predictors of response to docetaxel-carboplatin in patients with triple negative primary tumors. Response is defined as lack of invasive tumor in breast plus axilla after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (PCR, pathological complete response).",Miguel Martín Jiménez,1.0

NCT02850302,,PET with FDG; Tumor exome analysis,OTHER; OTHER,,COMPLETED,"Breast cancer is a major public health problem. In France, it is the leading cause of cancer death in women. According to the National Cancer Institute (INCA), approximately 49,000 new cases were diagnosed in 2012 in France.

It is an heterogeneous disease, comprising a plurality of entities whose clinical behavior, biological and prognosis differ. Amongst these entities, the breast cancer triple negative (TN) is defined by the absence of expression of estrogen receptor and progesterone and the absence of overexpression of HER2 oncoprotein. It represents about 15% of breast cancers and occurs more frequently in young women. This is a very proliferative tumor phenotype with metastatic potential. Because of its genomic heterogeneity and lack of recurrent identified molecular target, no targeted therapy has today shown benefit in terms of survival compared to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, which partly explains the very poor prognosis of this tumor phenotype. The positron emission tomography (PET) with 18Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) is a molecular imaging test that can identify from the first or second neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment non-responder patients to treatment with low probability of pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. For this two FDG-PET examinations should be performed; a) a pretreatment PET b) a control PET after one or two treatments.

Paclitaxel plus Gemcitabine (PG) combination chemotherapy is one of the preferred chemotherapeutic regimens for patients with MBC, and was found to be proper as a maintenance chemotherapy regimen with survival benefit and feasible toxicity profile as shown in a large phase III KCSG (Korean Cancer Study Group) study (Park Y et al. J Clin Oncol 31(14):1732, 2013).

Eribulin mesylate is a microtubule-targeting agent that showed improved overall survival benefit as monotherapy for MBC patients as a new chemotherapeutic agent after failure of anthracycline and taxane in EMBRACE study (Cortes J et. al. Lancet 377:914-923, 2011). Eribulin was also reported its promising efficacy in another randomized phase III study that demonstrated eribulin as efficacious as capecitabine (Kaufman P et. al. Abstr# S6-6, SABCS 2012). Both study results showed potential clinical benefit in patients with triple negative MBC (TNBC). Thus, eribulin combined with gemcitabine may be a new potential regimen for early line therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Furthermore, eribulin may have rational benefit compared with paclitaxel in terms of neurotoxicity. Although there is no direct evidence that eribulin has better neurotoxicity profile than taxane, eribulin tended to show less neurotoxicity compared with ixabepilone in a phase II trial (Vahdat, L et al. 2011 SABCS). Eribulin has no worsen toxicity as compared to paclitaxel. Therefore, EG may have less neurotoxicity comparing to PG.

In phase I trial, eribulin in combination with gemcitabine was feasible in patients with advanced solid tumor treated with chemotherapy (\< 3 lines) (Goel R, et al, 2009 ASCO).

Based on this rationale, the investigators are to conduct randomized phase II study comparing EG chemotherapy with PG chemotherapy for patients with HER-2 negative MBC as first-line chemotherapy.

This means that agents such as trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and tamoxifen are not currently treatment options for their cancer. Another option for treating the patient's cancer at this point is with chemotherapy. The patient should discuss this and other options with their doctor prior to entering this study.

Laboratory studies have demonstrated that ER is actually present in some triple negative breast cancers but is ""silenced"" (does not function properly) because methyl and histone groups are attached to it and inactivate it. Special drugs called demethylating inhibitors (such as decitabine) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (such as LBH589) can remove these methyl and histone groups and reactivate ER. This reactivated ER can then be targeted with agents like tamoxifen.

The patient is being asked to join this clinical research study to find out if ER can be reactivated in their cancer using decitabine in combination with LBH589. If ER is reactivated in their cancer, we will then determine if tamoxifen can decrease the growth of the cancer.",Emory University,0.0

NCT03358004,"An International, Multicenter, Phase II, Randomized, Parallel-arm Trial Investigating the Role of Two Different Metronomic Chemotherapy Regimens in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients (TNBC) as Maintenance Therapy After First Line Treatment",Vinorelbine Tartrate; Capecitabine 500 MG,DRUG; DRUG,,TERMINATED,"TNBC, defined by the lack of immunohistochemical staining for oestrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and lack of overexpression or amplification of HER2/neu, has an aggressive biological behaviour, marked by increased risk of recurrence and poorer survival compared with hormone receptor-positive subtypes.

The key points for the rationale of the present study are:

1. Despite different efforts for improving the outcome of TNBC patients, the median distant-disease free interval for relapsed triple-negative breast cancer is about 1-2 years, and the median survival for metastatic TNBC is approximately one year.
2. International guidelines currently recommend polychemotherapy instead of sequential single agents as first-line treatment in this subgroup of patients, but no data is available at the moment regarding the optimal duration of chemotherapy.
3. There is growing evidence to suggest that platinum-based therapy may have a role in both advanced and early-stage TNBC, though results are not definitive. Three randomized phase II neoadjuvant trials have been reported, two of which demonstrated an improvement in pathological complete response (pCR) rates when carboplatin is added to anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy, though this pCR improvement came at the cost of an increase in toxicity. Definitive results from phase III trials demonstrating improvement in long-term outcomes such as event-free and overall survival are not yet available, and it remains unclear how to optimally incorporate platinums into neoadjuvant therapy, as toxicity is enhanced when platinum is incorporated as an add-on to standard combination chemotherapy backbones. A randomized phase III trial comparing cisplatin plus gemcitabine to paclitaxel plus gemcitabine has been published recently. After a median follow-up of 16.3 months in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group and 15.9 months in the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group, the hazard ratio for progression-free survival was 0.692 (95% CI 0•523-0•915; pnon-inferiority\<0•0001, superiority=0•009. Thus cisplatin plus gemcitabine was both non-inferior to and superior to paclitaxel plus gemcitabine. Median progression-free survival was 7.7 months (95% CI 6.2-9.3) in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group and 6.5 months (5.8-7.2) in the paclitaxel plus gemcitabine group.
4. In both early and advanced disease settings, response rates appear to be influenced by germ line BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status, and BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status has emerged as an important potential biomarker for platinum therapy. Outside of the BRCA mutant setting, there is certainly good reason to believe that there are patients with sporadic TNBC who stand to benefit greatly from a platinum-based approach. Tumour-based assays that detect levels of genomic scarring caused by the accumulation of DNA damage over time secondary to underlying DNA repair defects, such as the Myriad HRD assay, have potential to identify non carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations with ""BRCA-like"" breast cancer, who may respond to DNA repair- targeted treatment strategies, such as platinum agents.

One of the most promising way to improve clinical outcome in poor-risk patients is represented by maintenance therapy with a non-cross resistant regimen after an induction treatment, until disease progression. Nevertheless, the main limit to such a strategy is the choice of chemotherapy agents, considering that patients could be treated for a long period of time The results of the VICTOR-1 study was recently published, the aim of this study was the determination of the maximum tolerated dose of oral metronomic schedule of vinorelbine (VNR) in combination with fixed doses of capecitabine (CAPE), as well as to confirm the safety profile of the combination in a cohort of HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients. The results demonstrated a lower incidence of hematological grade 3-4 adverse events (1.1%), in comparison to what published in other series, using the standard schedules of the two drugs. The present study is designed to select the best arm between oral metronomic schedule of vinorelbine (VNR) and combination of oral metronomic schedule VNR with fixed doses of capecitabine (CAPE) as maintenance therapy in advanced TNBC patients responders after an induction treatment.",Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research,0.0

The PPIs are FDA-approved, chronically used, and well tolerated so the investigators can move quickly from the laboratory to a proof of concept clinical trial.

TNBC is diagnosed in 15-20% of breast cancer cases and tends to occur in younger women and have biologically more aggressive high grade disease. Clinically, patients with TNBC have a poorer prognosis compared to patients diagnosed with other breast cancer subtypes. Because of the aggressive phenotype and due to observations that systemic chemotherapy offers significantly higher benefit in ER negative disease, current treatment guidelines from provincial and other organizations recommend that patients receive adjuvant systemic chemotherapy for any TNBC greater than 0.5 cm in greatest diameter or node positive independent of primary tumor size.

Currently, there is no world-wide standard recommended chemotherapy regimen for the management of TNBC in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting, with treatments varying from region and institution.

As physicians do not know what the ""best"" treatment for patients is, genuine uncertainty (""clinical equipoise"") exists. Physicians will choose between different ""standards"" in their personal practice, using idiosyncratic decision making processes, without the physician or the patient knowing the optimal option.

Breast cancer is the second most common cause of United States (U.S.) cancer deaths in women. Immunotherapy drugs use a person's immune system to fight cancer. Researchers want to see if a new combination of immunotherapy drugs can help treat breast cancer that has gone to places in the body outside of the breast (metastasized).

Objective:

To learn if a new combination of immunotherapy drugs can shrink tumors in people with metastatic breast cancer.

Eligibility:

Adults 18 and older who have been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, such as Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) or estrogen receptors (ER)-/progesterone receptors (PR)-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ Breast Cancer (HER2+BC)

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

medical history

physical exam

disease confirmation (or tumor biopsy)

tumor scans (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or bone scan)

blood and urine tests

electrocardiogram (measures the hearts electrical activity)

echocardiogram (creates images of the heart).

Participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 groups. The drugs they get will be based on the group they are in. Drugs are given in cycles. Each cycle = 3 weeks. Participants will be seen in clinic every 3 weeks, prior to the start of a new cycle. At each visit, participants will have an clinical exam, have blood drawn and will be asked about any side effects. They will repeat the screening tests during the study. New scans, like a computed tomography (CT) scan, will be done every 6 weeks to see if the treatment is working.

All participants will get Bavarian Nordic (BN)-Brachyury. It is 2 different vaccines - a prime and a boost. First the priming vaccines, called MVA-BN-Brachyury help to jump start the immune system. Next the boosting vaccines, called fowlpox virus (FPV)-Brachyury help to keep the immune system going. They are injected under the skin during different cycles.

All participants will get M7824 (also known as Bintrafusp alfa), which is an immunotherapy drug. Some participants will get a commonly used drug is HER2+ breast cancer called adotrastuzumab emtansine (also known as T-DM1DM1 or kadcyla). For both, a needle is inserted into a vein to give the drugs slowly.

Some participants will take Entinostat weekly by mouth. It is in tablet form. Participants will keep a pill diary.

Participants will continue on their assigned treatment until their cancer grows, they develop side effects or want to stop treatment. About 28 days after treatment ends, participants will have a follow-up visit or a telephone call. Then they will be contacted every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for 1 year.

- The experimental cancer treatment drug ABT-888 (Veliparib) works by preventing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair in tumor cells. Cyclophosphamide is a cancer treatment drug that works by causing DNA damage in cells, including cancer cells, resulting in cell death. However, because cyclophosphamide has strong and unpleasant side effects, researchers are interested in finding drugs that can be given in combination with cyclophosphamide that will allow a lower dose of cyclophosphamide to be given with similar effects. The combination of ABT-88 and cyclophosphamide may be an effective treatment for some types of cancer, such as certain kinds of breast or ovarian cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that often do not respond to standard therapies.

Objectives:

- To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ABT-888 and cyclophosphamide in ovarian and breast cancer and in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that have not responded to standard treatments.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with (1) (Breast cancer 1/2) BRCA1/2 ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal or ovarian high-grade carcinoma, or fallopian tube cancer; (2) triple-negative breast cancer (not responsive to hormone-related therapy); or (3) low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, and tumor imaging studies. Participants will be divided into two groups with different treatment subgroups.
* Group 1: Participants who have BRCA-positive ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal or ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma, or fallopian tube cancer

NCT03197805,Prospective Study Assessing the Impact of RNA Genomic Profile Defined by a Genomic Test on Treatment Decision-making in Breast Cancer Patients With an ISH Equivocal HER2 Status- EQUIVOK Study,PAM 50 test,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST,,TERMINATED,"The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the /College of American Pathologists (CAP) recommend that HER2 status (negative or positive) must be determined in all patients with invasive breast cancer. The knowledge of HER2 status will help the oncologist in prescribing or not a HER2-targeted therapy to patients. Presently, two main methods are used to assess HER2 status: immunohistochemistry (IHC, protein expression) and in situ hybridization (ISH, gene expression) in order to classify tumor sample as positive, negative or equivocal. When a tumor is classified HER 2+ by IHC method, a second test is performed using ISH methods (FISH, SISH, CISH). In case of HER2 equivocal result with ISH method (4 ≤HER2 gene number copy \<6), the patient is eligible to an anti-HER2 therapy after discussed during MD-MM. This decision should be individualized on the basis of patient status (comorbidities and prognosis) and patient preferences after discussing available clinical evidence.

Based on molecular classification, RNA expression could help to discriminate breast cancer subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-overexpressed and triple negative). Prosigna is a genomic test, developed by NanoString® based on the PAM50 gene signature, which measures the expression of 50 genes to classify tumors into 1 of 4 intrinsic subtypes and could allow determining the HER2 status.

This study was designed in order to define if such a test could help the oncologist to define the better therapeutic decision in a HER2 equivocal population. In addition, concordance tests will be performed.

In other words, the study drug, entinostat, is not being given to treat cancer. Instead, the study team is looking at the effects of entinostat on tumor tissue for research purposes only.

Approximately 246,660 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the United States in 2016. Its detection and treatment remains a major concern in women's healthcare. In particular, TNBC accounts for approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers. Research into treatment for breast cancer relies more and more on understanding how the cancer cells act when they are exposed to an anti-cancer drug. How most cancer cells act when exposed to anti-cancer drugs and which patients as a result may benefit the most from these drugs is not well known. Additional studies are required to determine the cells' reactions. The purpose of part 1 of this study is to better understand how TNBC tumors react to one particular cancer drug, entinostat. Entinostat is currently being studied across multiple clinical trials for the treatment of breast cancer, other solid tumors and blood cancers. Entinostat is investigational and has not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of cancer.

Studies have shown that a good way to determine how cancer acts when exposed to anti-cancer drugs is a short-term preoperative window study. In this type of study, subjects receive a study drug a couple of days before surgery. Leftover tissue from surgery is then used to determine some of the effects that a study drug may have on the tumor. In this study, subjects will receive two doses of entinostat prior to undergoing planned surgery. Leftover tissue from this surgery will then be used to determine the effects entinostat has on tumor cells. For example, the study team will examine if the types of genes and proteins that the tumor expresses as a result of entinostat exposure increases or decreases the likelihood that the tumor will not continue to grow. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes make up the chemical structure carrying your genetic information that may determine human characteristics (i.e., eye color, height and sex).

The trial will be conducted in Switzerland with max. 90 patients. CR1447 has a very good safety and tolerability profile and combines two mechanisms of action, interaction with the AR and the aromatase enzyme may have a higher activity than drugs with a single mechanism and might offer the possibility of non-chemotherapy based endocrine therapy to the limited treatment options in TN-ARpos BC. Transdermal application of CR1447 might have the advantage to continuously release of 4-OHT into the blood stream, thus omitting a first pass effect.

In Phase II the main objective is to assess activity and to determine the efficacy and tolerability of CR1447. Phase II will consist of two strata, into which patients will be stratified according to their hormonal receptor status: Stratum A for patients with endocrine responsive-HER2neg disease, regardless of their AR status and Stratum B for patients with triple-negative and determined ARpos disease. Patients with triple-negative disease tested negative for AR will be excluded from the trial.

In both strata patients will be treated with 400 mg of CR1447 until disease progression, patients' wish or physicians' decision to end treatment. Biopsies of one defined metastatic lesion in those patients who gave informed consent will be performed at baseline and within the third week of treatment with CR1447.

In this project standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be used concordant with summary of product characteristics (SPC). However during treatment (including days of chemotherapy application) an additional modifier of therapy will be carried out in the form of intense physical activity. This strategy is not recognized in SPC. This project aims to improve the results of breast cancer treatment in young women. According to available data, nowadays this subset of breast cancer patients has worse therapy results in comparison to older women. This is partially because of the different tumor characteristics; young women are more likely to present with human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor overexpression or with triple negative breast cancer. In the treatment of YWBC, preoperative chemotherapy is most often the first step. This enables the opportunity to assess the effectiveness of additional interventions in a mode it was never tested before. It is believed that physical activity improves the results of breast cancer treatment, however there are only few reports describing its benefit and role in terms of preoperative chemotherapy.

In the current project, the investigators planned to introduce supervised increased physical activity concurrently with neoadjuvant treatment in YWBC at early stage of disease. The main goal of the study is to assess the effect of physical activity on preoperative chemotherapy outcomes.

The usual approach is defined as care most people get for this type of cancer. The usual approach for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer who are not in a study is chemotherapy with drugs like paclitaxel, carboplatin, cisplatin, eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, gemcitabine, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide. There is a protein called PD-L1 that helps regulate the body's immune system. For patients who have PD-L1+ tumors, immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) is usually added to paclitaxel or carboplatin/gemcitabine as initial treatment. For patients who have PD-L1-negative tumors, chemotherapy alone is used, without immunotherapy. ASTX727 is a combination of two drugs, decitabine and cedazuridine. Cedazuridine is in a class of medications called cytidine deaminase inhibitors. It prevents the breakdown of decitabine, making it more available in the body so that decitabine will have a greater effect. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

This type of breast cancer can be more difficult to treat than other types of breast cancer as it does not respond to drugs such as hormonal therapies. One type of treatment that looks promising is immunotherapy using new drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Immune checkpoints help to regulate the immune system and can stop the immune system from attacking cancer cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors block this 'off-switch' and aim to help the immune system control the cancer. These drugs have been very effective in other cancers such as melanoma and are now being tested in breast cancer.

In this study patients will receive an immune checkpoint inhibitor called avelumab. Half the patients on the study will also receive aspirin tablets for approximately 18 days as the investigators wish to compare the effects of avelumab alone versus in combination with aspirin.

Patients will attend hospital approximately five times in order to complete all necessary study assessments.

NCT03358017,"Multicenter, Randomized, Phase II Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Associated or Not With Zoledronate and Atorvastatin in Triple Negative Breast Cancers - YAPPETIZER Study",Zoledronate; Atorvastatin 80mg; Standard neoadjuvant cht,DRUG; DRUG; DRUG,,COMPLETED,"Recent evidences suggest that zoledronate, one of the most used bisphosphonates (BPs) in the clinical setting for the prevention and treatment of bone metastasis in cancer patients, may have antitumor activity in early breast cancer. The ABCSG-12 clinical trial have reported improved Disease Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in mostly chemotherapy naive premenopausal patients after a 3-years of treatment with zoledronate (zol) and ovarian-suppression therapy. The ZO-FAST study showed better DFS for immediate use of zol in postmenopausal patients receiving adjuvant hormonal treatment. Preliminary evidences support the role of zoledronate also in neoadjuvant setting reporting better responses in cases of treatment with zol and chemotherapy (cht) compared with cht alone. The anticancer mechanism of action of BPs still remains not well understood. Basically, BPs are mevalonate (MVA) pathway inhibitors and one of the most intriguing hypothesis supporting their anticancer activity relies on the modulation of the mevalonate downstream metabolism. Selected cancer subtypes may present a more pronounced mevalonate activity able to confer an aggressive phenotype. It has been shown that a mutant p53 acts as promoter of MVA upregulation. One of the most important biological implications of MVA pathway upregulation in cancer cells is the aberrant activation of the Hippo pathway, a molecular axis with a central role in carcinogenesis. Two Hippo pathway related transcriptional coactivators, YAP and TAZ, promote tissue proliferation and the self-renewal of normal and cancer stem cells, and incite metastasis. Due to the strong interplay between the MVA and Hippo pathways, the modulation of MVA axis has deep impact on the function of YAP/TAZ as transcriptional regulators of tumour growth. These findings implicate the mevalonate pathway as a therapeutic target for selected tumors with up-regulation of these pathways.

Preclinical and clinical evidences suggest that BPs are able to interfere with YAP/TAZ expression, via MVA pathway. This kind of activity may be part of the mechanism of action of BPs as antitumor drugs. Others medications are able to modulate the MVA pathway. Statins, a first-class of lipid-lowering medications that inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, inhibit the sterol biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway. A possible anti-tumor effect of statins can be predicted with the same mechanism of action described for BPs, through the interference with the MVA axis. Actually, the anti-tumor activity of statins have been investigated in different retrospective analyses. In breast cancer a more robust signal has been retrospectively reported and prospective studies have enquired the exquisite antitumor activity of statins in pre-operative breast cancer setting. From above, the clinical trial herein proposed aims to investigate the antitumoral clinical activity of zoledronate (zol) and statins (atorvastatin) combination, in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The primary objective of the study is to address in patients with TNBC the antitumor activity of pre-operative standard chemotherapy associated or not with zoledronate (zol) and atorvastatin measured through its effect on YAP and TAZ immunochemistry (IHC) expressions, which are considered co-primary objectives.

The primary clinical objective is to assess the anti-tumor activity of the combination of neoadjuvant standard cht associated with zol and atorvastatin, measured by the proportion of pCR obtained after neoadjuvant treatment in patients with TNBC.

Secondary objectives are: 1) to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of pre-operative standard chemotherapy associated or not with zol and atorvastatin according to high/low p53 levels 2) to address the efficacy of neoadjuvant cht associated or not with zol/atorvastatin combo in terms of disease free survival and overall survival); 3) to study the safety profile of study treatments; 4) to investigate the treatment modulation of YAP and TAZ gene expression (RNA-Seq) in tumor tissues collected at the time of core-biopsy and definitive surgery; 5) to address the modulation of Ki67expression by IHC in the FFPE diagnostic core biopsy tumor block and in the tumor tissue collected at surgery.

NCT02347163,"A Multicenter, Single-arm, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Activity of Pre-operative Zoledronate in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients, According to p53 Level",Zoledronate,DRUG,,TERMINATED,"Recent evidences suggest that zoledronate (zol), one of the most used bisphosphonates (BPs) in the clinical setting for the prevention and treatment of bone metastasis in cancer patients, may have antitumor activity in early breast cancer in terms of improved disease free survival, overall survival and better response in BPs treated patients. BPs are mevalonate pathway inhibitors and one of the most intriguing hypothesis supporting their anticancer activity relies on the modulation of the mevalonate downstream metabolism. Biologically active mevalonate metabolites are involved in tumour cell proliferation and invasion and selected cancer subtypes may present a more pronounced mevalonate activity, able of maintaining an aggressive phenotype. The mevalonate pathway has deep impact on the function of YAP/TAZ, transcriptional regulators of tumour growth, and preclinical evidences suggest that BPs are able to interfere with YAP/TAZ expression, via mevalonate pathway. This study addresses the clinical role of BPs in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients selected by the level of mevalonate pathway regulation, namely the p53 expression. This study is a multicenter single-arm, phase II study primarily aimed at assessing the anti-tumor activity of pre-operative zol measured through its effect on the Ki67 proliferative biomarker, in TNBC patients classified according to the p53 expression (high vs low p53 expression). Patients with newly diagnosed, untreated, operable TNBC, intended to definitive breast surgery and suitable for pre-operative therapy with zoledronate will receive a pre-operative, single administration of zol (4mg i.v.), 7 days before definitive breast surgery. Ki67 levels will be assessed in tumor samples collected at the time of diagnosis and after zoledronate treatment at the time of definitive surgery. The secondary objective of the study is to investigate the effect of zoledronate on critical genes/proteins related to p53 and mevalonate pathways, p53/PIN1 and YAP/TAZ, analyzed in the tumor tissue collected at the time of diagnosis and at definitive surgery. Zol safety profile will be evaluated by the NCI-CTCAE scale, version 4.0, and by the occurrence of serious adverse reactions. The total number of patients required is forty.

* All cells go through cycles which allow them to divide. In normal cells, checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) (CHEK 2 (Chk1/2) stop cell division at various points to allow any damage to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to be repaired.
* When Chk1/2 are not present, cells stop dividing and eventually die. Chk1/2 Inhibitor (Prexasertib (LY2606368) blocks the Chk1/2 proteins.
* Researchers hope that by blocking Chk1/2, it will cause tumor cells to die, thereby shrinking tumors.

Objective:

- To see if LY2606368 helps shrink tumors in patients with certain breast, ovarian or prostate cancers.

Eligibility:

- Participants at least 18 years old with breast or ovarian cancer. They must have a mutation in BRCA1 BReast CAncer gene 1 and BRCA2 BReast CAncer gene 2 (BRCA1/2) genes for group 1, high grade serious ovarian cancer without BRCA1/2 mutation for group 2, or triple negative breast cancer without BRCA1/2 mutation for group 3, or prostate cancer with or without BRCA1/2 mutation for group 4.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have blood tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG) heart test, scans, and X-rays. They will have a piece of their tumor removed at entry (computed tomography (CT)-assisted biopsy).
* Study Day 1: Participants will have a physical exam and blood drawn. They may have a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
* Day 1 and Day 15 of each 28-day cycle: Participants will receive the study drug through an intravenous (IV).
* Vital signs will be checked before and after. An ECG will be done within 1 hour after.

NCT04879888,Estudio clínico Fase I de Inmunoterapia Con Vacunas sintéticas Personalizadas en Pacientes Con cáncer de Mama Triple Negativo,Peptide pulsed Dendritic cell,BIOLOGICAL,,COMPLETED,"Due to their genetic instability, breast tumors that do not express receptors for Estrogens, Progestagens or amplify the Her2 / neu oncogene \[called triple-negative breast cancer (TNTC)\] and other tumors such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, accumulate numerous mutations that make them highly resistant to different regimens of chemo- or radiotherapy, thereby generating high morbidity and mortality. However, immunology can turn the genetic instability of tumors into the Achilles' tendon. Evidence of this has been revealed in Phase I clinical studies in patients with melanoma and lung cancer in an advanced stage of metastasis treated with Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) to decrease immunosuppression, in whom peptides containing mutations presented in Major Complex molecules Histocompatibility of Class I (HCM I) of the tumor itself results in their recognition as ""foreign"" neo-antigens leading to the efficient destruction of the tumor by anti-tumor CD8 + T lymphocytes that are amplified when they are vaccinated with these peptides.

For this reason, the identification of non-synonymous mutations of single amino acid and vaccination with 25 amino acid peptides that incorporate these mutations (synthetic vaccines) is emerging today as an alternative for immunotherapy of cancers responsible for high mortality in humans. In an approach that takes 16 weeks, today, it is possible to go from the analysis of the tumor's transcriptome (which allows identifying the universe of tumor mutations) to the patient's vaccination with a personalized vaccine that contains neo-antigens of his tumor.

TNBC is the most aggressive breast tumor, representing around 25% of breast cancers in our environment. While generally, at least 30% of women with other types of metastatic breast cancer survive 5 years after diagnosis, most patients diagnosed with metastatic CMTN die within this time. The lack of selective therapies and the poor prognosis of patients with NTMC make their therapeutic management difficult, so the implementation of new therapies for this type of tumor is the main focus of researchers who seek more effective and selective treatments to improve the life expectancy of patients without compromising their quality of life. The genetic instability and high rate of mutations of the TNBC most likely favor the generation of neo-epitopes. Still, due to the immunosuppressive environment of the tumor, it escapes the immunosurveillance of the immune system. Despite the high mortality induced by this tumor, a percentage of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with agents such as Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (AC) + Taxanes respond to this chemotherapy regimen. In particular, the anti-tumor effect of AC is attributed to two things: (i) the direct cytotoxic effect on the tumor cell, (ii) the immunostimulation of T lymphocytes promoted by Immunogenic Cell Death (ICM) selectively induced by these drugs. Therefore, in this project, we propose to carry out the first clinical study in Colombia of vaccination of patients with TNBC with synthetic peptides that contain mutations of their own tumor to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of this type of personalized vaccine as a therapeutic alternative for this tumor. Achieving the specific objectives set out in this project would mean that we have been validated in Colombia the experimental design necessary to identify unique epitopes in tumors and demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines. We consider that having achieved the above; we will have taken an important step towards the implementation in our country of the use of this type of vaccine for immunotherapy not only of TNBC but of other tumors such as glioblastoma, gastric, esophagus, and pancreas, highly fatal due to its high mutation rate.",Universidad Nacional de Colombia,1.0

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly used in patients with operable breast cancer to enhance the likelihood of breast conservation. New generation of treatments or combinations lead to a high rate of pathological complete responses (pCR) in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2) and triple negative tumours. Safe omission of surgery in patients who receive NAC and achieve radiologic complete response depends on the ability to accurately estimate pCR preoperatively.

If pathological complete response after NAC could be accurately assessed by VAB, surgery could be avoided. In the context of new treatments or combinations with an increased pCR rate, this new strategy could induce major changes in clinical practice, leading to breast surgery de-escalation.",Centre Georges Francois Leclerc,1.0

NCT04101851,"Omission of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Triple-negative and HER2-positive Breast Cancer Patients with Radiologic and Pathologic Complete Response in the Breast After Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy: a Single-arm, Prospective Surgical Trial.",omission of SLNB,PROCEDURE,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Currently, axillary surgery for breast cancer is considered as staging procedure that does not seem to influence breast cancer mortality, since the risk of developing metastasis depends mainly on the biological behaviour of the primary (seed-and-soil model). Based on this, the postsurgical therapy should be considered on the basis of biologic tumor characteristics rather than nodal involvement.

Improvements in systemic treatments for breast cancer have increased the rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST), offering the opportunity to decrease, and perhaps eliminate, surgery in patients who have a pCR.

The investigators designed a clinical trial in which only patients with the highest likelihood of having a pCR after NAST (triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancer) will be included and type of surgery will be defined according to the response to NAST rather than on the classical T and N status at presentation. In the planned trial, axillary surgery will be eliminated completely (no axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy \[SLNB\]) for initially cN0 patients with radiologic complete remission (rCR) and a breast pCR as determined in the lumpectomy specimen.

The trial design is a multicenter single-arm study with a limited number of patients (N=350) which might give practice-changing results in a short period of time, sparing the time and the costs of a randomized comparison. Patients will be recruited in European countries (Austria, Germany, Italy, and Spain) over a period of 48 months.","Toralf Reimer, MD PhD",1.0

NCT04142554,Window of Opportunity Study of Parsaclisib in Subjects With Newly Diagnosed Stage I-IIIC Triple-Negative or HER2-Positive Breast Cancer,Parsaclisib,DRUG,,WITHDRAWN,"The purpose of this research study is to find the lowest dose of the cancer drug parsaclisib that has an effect on the type of breast cancer a participant has. Researchers are looking at how Parsaclisib affects the immune system. They want to learn whether and how it helps the immune system to find cancer cells to fight them.

Parsaclisib is an oral drug that limits the effects of a protein called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase δ (PI3K). By limiting P13K, parsaclisib can block certain cells that prevent the immune cells from working. As a result, it may help the body's immune system to fight tumors. Parsaclisib is being studied in several clinical trials to treat different types of cancers. Parsaclisib has not yet been approved by FDA for the treatment of cancer.

Studies have shown that a good way to find out how cancer acts when exposed to anti-cancer drugs is through a pre-operative window study. In this type of study, tissue and blood are collected before treatment. Then subjects receive a study drug for a few weeks before surgery. Blood is drawn during the course of treatment, and leftover tissue is collected during surgery. Comparing the tissue and blood before and after treatment shows the effects the study drug may have had on the tumor.

Research shows that cancers differ when you look at the DNA and RNA (genetic codes) that are inside a cancer cell. DNA and RNA carry genetic information that can determine traits in humans (such as eye color, height, reaction to treatment, etc.), as well as the traits of cancer cells. Depending on the genetic profile (particularly DNA and RNA) of the cancer, it may respond differently to parsaclisib. In this study, the investigators will look at the genetic profile of a participant's tumor by studying tissue and blood samples collected before and after receiving treatment.",UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center,0.0

All patients involved in this trial would undergo a defined protocol. All patients participating in this trial and all members of the investigation team would be completely introduced to the plan and aims of this trial.

Two main hypotheses of this trial are that SLNB does not have a negative impact on clinical outcomes (locoregional recurrence and overall survival) in initially node-positive patients who achieved complete clinically axillary remission after neoadjuvant systemic treatment and that lymph node status after neoadjuvant treatment is a significantly more relevant prognostic factor than nodal status at the time of diagnosis.

Therefore, the aim is to establish that sentinel lymph node biopsy, in node-positive breast cancer patients that achieve clinical remission after neoadjuvant treatment, is a reliable approach for surgical axillary management.

Data would be collected individually for each patient and recorded on appropriate forms. After data completion, the principal investigator would import encoded data into the register. Data collected in this trial would be used for publications.",Clinical Hospital Center Rijeka,1.0
